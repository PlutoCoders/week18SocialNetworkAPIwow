## Goal of the Project
- Your challenge is to build an API for a social network web application where users can share their thoughts, react to friends’ thoughts, and create a friend list. You’ll use Express.js for routing, a MongoDB database, and the Mongoose ODM. 

- In addition to using the Express.js Links to an external site. and Mongoose Links to an external site. packages, you may also optionally use a JavaScript date library of your choice or the native JavaScript Date object to format timestamps.

## How to test this project
- Install insomnia to test routes
- run npm run start
- make sure your mongoDB has the DB from the server.js and vice versa connected up
- in insomnia, you will do get, post, delete routes for users, thoughts, friends, and reactions.
- an example of a post user route: URL: http://localhost:3001/api/users - then the json body: {
    "username": "test4",
    "email": "tes4@test.com"
}
